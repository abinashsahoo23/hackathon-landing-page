## gothic-cathedral.jpg
"A towering Gothic cathedral shrouded in thin wisps of fog, illuminated by moonlight. The massive stone structure features intricate flying buttresses, elaborate stained glass windows glowing with faint blue light, and impossibly tall spires that seem to pierce a twilight sky filled with stars. In the foreground, an ornate wrought iron gate with twisted decorative elements. The entire scene has a dark, atmospheric quality with deep shadows and dramatic lighting that highlights the architectural details. Photorealistic, cinematic lighting, dramatic atmosphere, 8k resolution."

## gothic-rose.jpg
"A single black rose with droplets of dew or blood against a weathered stone background. The rose is perfectly detailed with velvety petals and a subtle sheen. Small droplets of moisture catch and reflect minimal light. The background is a textured, ancient stone surface with faint carvings or symbols barely visible. The lighting is subdued and atmospheric with dramatic shadows. The color palette is primarily dark with hints of deep burgundy in the rose. Photorealistic, macro photography style, shallow depth of field, high detail, 8k resolution."

## texture-bg.jpg
"A seamless dark texture resembling old Victorian wallpaper or aged parchment. The pattern features subtle Gothic motifs like stylized fleurs-de-lis, thorny vines, or damask patterns. The background is primarily deep charcoal or very dark purple with the pattern elements in slightly lighter shades or with a faint metallic quality. The texture appears aged and weathered with subtle stains or discoloration that gives it character and depth. High resolution, tileable pattern, subtle details, vintage feel, 4k resolution."

## cta-background.jpg
"A dramatic Gothic landscape viewed through an ornate stone arch window. The scene shows a misty valley at dusk with the silhouettes of Gothic spires and ruins in the distance. The foreground features part of the stone window frame with intricate carvings and perhaps a section of stained glass catching the last light. The sky has dramatic clouds illuminated by moonlight with stars becoming visible. The color palette is primarily dark blues, purples, and blacks with highlights of silver moonlight. Cinematic, atmospheric, high contrast, photorealistic, 8k resolution."
